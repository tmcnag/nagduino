nagduino
========

An Arduino agent for monitoring the physical world with Nagios (NRDP)

Overview
========

I'll be updating this project more after the conference, but I wanted to at least get it out there even in its current inglorious state.

In order to use the library, place the nagduino folder in your Arduino library directory.  Please reference the nagduino_nrdp_send sketch for example usage.

If you have any questions, feel free to post them here for public benefit.  And bear in mind, I'm not a developer so please excuse any sloppy code  :)

Support
========

I would prefer if all questions, comments, etc. were asked here for the sake of organization, but if you need to email me please feel free to do so.  There is also a page on the Nagios support forums where the project was announced, but questions posted there would better server the community by being posted here.
