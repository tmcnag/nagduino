nagduino
========

An Arduino agent for monitoring the physical world with Nagios (NRDP)

Overview
========

In order to use the library, place the nagduino folder in your Arduino library directory.  Please reference the nagduino_nrdp_send sketch for example usage.

If you have any questions, feel free to post them here for public benefit.  And bear in mind, I'm not a developer so please excuse any sloppy code  :)

Support
========

I would prefer if all questions, comments, etc. were asked here for the sake of organization, just open an Issue.  There is also a page on the Nagios support forums where the project was announced, but questions posted there would better serve the community by being posted here.
